Most of the people have missed the point.Â\\xa0 It is not a question of whether or not Kenya has slums.Â\\xa0 Every country does!Â\\xa0 The issue here is that so many of the first world countries only show the underprivileged side of the nation. Someone has come up to show that there is a gorgeous side of the country divergent to what people think or see in the media . Yes, we have the largest slum in East Africa, but we also have the most beautiful Hilton there.Â\\xa0 Give this guy credit!Â\\xa0 Thanks for divulging the beautiful site of Kenya!

       "  'text': \"Traveler is right. All cities have slums. Johannesburg has some of the worst i've ever seen but somehow they remain hidden from the media. The slums in Nairobi are child play. The city centre of Jo'burg is also one of the most unsafe and dirty. Lagos is better. You'll be lucky to walk through unmugged if you're misguided enough to go shopping in town. The suburbs however are superb. You would think you're somewhere in N America. And the roads, they're out of this world. Even Europe is no match.Nairobi is extremely beautiful with a superb weather. I hear they've commissioned the start of construction of several superhighways with eight lanes with the help of the Chinese.Â\\xa0 The airport also is being refurbished and expanded to become one of the biggest and most modern in the Southern horizon. If you've been to Nairobi lately, you will notice that litering, spitting and smoking in public is illegal. Throw a sweet wrapping on the ground and you'll end up facing a magistrate.Without oil and literally no natural mineral resources, Kenya overtook the European Union to become the largest exporter of manufactured goods into the Comesa region. The country has not factored in donor aid in its budget the last three years making it one of the first in Africa to attempt sovereignty from donors and the Bretton Wood institutions. The economy is owned by Kenyans and multinationals like BP are leaving because they cannot compete with local petrol distributors. Nandos, Steers and all those international chains of restaurants have been literally routed out of Nairobi and other cities by indigenous restaurants that sell quality locally sourced cuisines at half the price. SAfrican Supreme Furnitures and Barnette could not compete with local artisans and left the country. Others like Shoprite, Game and Pick and Pay have been unable to penetrate the Kenyan dominated supermarket sector. SAB tried to enter the East African market in a big way with Castle Lager only to be outdone by Kenya-based and indigenous East African Breweries and had to bow out. Nairobi Stock Exchange is literally owned by ordinary Kenyans, who line up everyday to buy shares. Kenya airways is among the 5 most profitable airlines in the world. When the airline was privatized a few years ago more than 70% shares went to Kenyans. Only 29% was sold to KLM - a strategic partnership that really paid off. What is happening to Nigeria ohh? Right, left, centre in Lagos is South African products and companies. Even our oil is not ours ! O lordie! God help us. 16 Likes   3 Shares\",\n",

Yes, we do have slums and no one disputes that but we have seen enough of slums; after all that has been the favourite topic of all photographers! There is a nicer cleaner part of Nairobi that must be shown side to side with the slums.  These are not even the very best of Nairobi, there is more.  Then there is the countryside, dry lands, wet lands. It is a rich country and I can attest to that being Kenyan.  And Ogza, I have to admit that I too was impressed by that camera!

       "  'text': \"Kenya, whose capital city is Nairobi, is by large an agricultural economy. However, the service industry has in recent years become one of the main foreign exchange earner.As such, manufacturing is agriculture-based. for instance, apart from coffee and tea, Kenya is the largest producer of dairy products and pyrethrum in Africa. In addition, Kenya is the biggest producer in the world of cut flowers and fresh beans, supplying 25% of all flowers and beans into EU. On the other hand, Kenya being the most dominant economy in east and central africa, other major manufacturing in the region is based in Nairobi e.g motor vehicle assembly, pharmaceautical & chemical production, beverages (alcohol) etc.The service industry comprises of tourism, conference facilities and supply of labour abroad. By the way, remittances from Kenyans in the Diaspora is second only to Nigeria in Africa, Kenya has the second largest number of African students studying in America and Europe (second only to Nigeria). Suprising Kenya's population is only 32 million.Apart from contributions by Kenyans to their economy, Kenya has benefited alot from having one of the most connected capital cities (Nairobi) in the world. Apart from Kenya Airways, airlines like Virgin Atlantic, British Airways, SA Airways and Emirates fly to Nairobi. In addition, Nairobi hosts global headquaters of UNEP and Habitat, major UN organisations. It is not suprising that Coffi Anan (former UN secretary general) has choosen Nairobi as the continental headquarters of his new organisation, AGRA. Other organisations with regional headquarters in Nairobi include, CELTEL Africa, Coca-cola, Scangroup, Unilever and East Africa Breweries. I hope 'Naijaway' is enlightened about Kenya. One more thing, there are no chiefs or community kings. You don't have to say ''yes sir'' every time you respond to your boss. He might think you are funny if you do that in Nairobi. 1 Like   1 Share\",\n",

For anyone familiar with Canada, they know that Ice Hockey is the national sport just as soccer (or football) is in the rest of the world, but I hate hockey. My friends always wonder why, I told them, we do not play hockey in Africa, and that one will never find a hockey rink in anywhere in Africa.

Apart from the negative publicity by international news agency about Nai, as we call it here, it is the most beautiful city in Africa. These are the true pictures of the City. Nai can only compete with cities like Cape Town. Not even J'burg can compete with this city. A foreign journalist once referred this city as 'New York' of Africa, With its connection to many parts of the world, its the gateway to Africa. Our own vibrant national carrier can only competes with the likes of Emirates, British Aiways, Virgin Atlantic and Qatar Airlines which they operate thrice daily flights between London and Nairobi (Kenya airways and British Airways), thrice daily flights between Nairobi and Dubai (Kenya airways (KQ) and Emirates) the list is endless, with connections to more than 30 cities in Africa from its Nairobi hub, KQ link Africa to the world, so tell me with this kind of airlines making Nairobi as regional offices, what can prevent Nairobi from developing as a World class city? Is there a national carrier for Nigeria? I once heard it collapsed!Further more Nairobi is ranked as one of the best African cities with Cape Town, Cairo and J'burg, where is Lagos in the list? Because we offer world class indeginous shopping malls. Take for example the SA companies which have dominated other African countries like Shoprite, MTN, Vodacom and many others, u wont find any of this in Kenya because there are Kenyan world class companies.Kenyan supermarket chains like Nakumatt and Uchumi are expanding to other African countries to compete with South Africans.While castle beer brand has dominated other African markets, it not the case in Kenya, where the Nairobi product Tusker is fast becoming the African beer brand. Furthermore, it is the only city in Africa with an Ice hockey rink, soon we will be having ice hockey team in world championships and olympics, we say 'play ice hockey in the equator'!You gotta visit Nairobi to prove it yourself!   \",\n",

These refugees have come, among other countries, from Rwanda, Uganda, Zaire, Congo, Ethiopia, Somalia and Sudan. Most of these refugees not only become slum dwellers but are a heavy burden on Kenyan taxpayer. However, it is not often one hears of the Kenyan citizens complaining of this burden. The Kenyan people are some of the most hospitable people in Africa. So, for once, let us enjoy any part of the country that bears any beauty without reminding us of what we already very well know.I think all Africans have come a long way. Every African country has a lot to be proud of. We Africans took up over other peoples' way of life and we are not doing such a bad job with the difficult change. Some of the European countries have been in existance for hundrends of years. Africa has only been doing the western 'thing' for a few decades. Let us not be too hard on ourselves. I think Nigeria has done a very good job in leading the rest of Africa considering how overpopulated the country is. We in Kenya look up and admire Nigeria in how they have managed to retain their cultural costumes and ways. What we need to cultivate is love for each other and less criticism. We also need to exchange cultures and help each other in creating abetter tomorrow for our children. 1 Like  \",\n",

As for Kenyans owning the tallest buildings, I stand corrected. Could you advise me whether it was also Kenyan contractors who carried out the building work? And the investments - are they all Kenyan too?  The Hilton Tower is non-African owned. Is there a Sheraton? If not, there soon will be. And it will probably be taller than the Hilton! Tell me, how many McDonald's restaurants are there in Nairobi? McDonald's is the first sign of Western colonisation in any non-Western country. This is a fact, confirmed by American citizens, like Michael Moore.With all due respect, you cannot possibly say that there is no discrimination and no problems in Kenya. It is only when people like akshar have experienced the discrimination that they can talk about it. Kenya is no different to any other country. ALL have problems. ALL have discrimination of some sort.It's like saying there's no racism in England or America! Ask a victim of racism in those countries!Nairobi city buildings are owned, were designed and constructed by Kenyans. Times Tower one of Africa's top ten tallest buildings was designed and constructed by Kenyan owned companies, from architects to civil engineers they are the local boyz and women.There is no Mcdonalds or Sheraton in Kenya. We have local restaurants like Kengeles, Kenchic-the popular chicken restaurant in Kenya on every street in Nairobi and Java House for the best hot cup of coffee.Politically, Kenyans enjoys the most freedom of expression in Africa. A cabinet minister can say anything against the president n nothing can b done to him/her neither can he/she b sacked. Furthermore, UN bodies prefer to employ Kenyans. Currently, there are 700,000 Kenyans working for the UN bodies only second to the US. These Kenyans contribute to over 350 million dollars to Kenya's economy annually.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'My issue with the westâ€™s portrayal of Kenya and Africa in general, is the inability of western reporters to show the duality of African economies. What we see almost daily on TV, is the great poverty that ravages the continent. Kenya has an immense portion of its population living in poverty, but it also has a segment of its people living better than people in the West. I really appreciate the photos of Kenya posted on this website because it shows a side of Kenya we do not get to see much of. Its good to see that the city of Nairobi has infrastructure that parallels those in any major European or American city. This could even have the effect of encouraging investors to view Africa as an untapped gem, which has the necessary factors needed to prosper â€“ Infrastructure, An educated population, Political Stability, etc. I hear these talks of insecurity in Kenya. I lived in Nairobi most of my adult life before moving to the US. Insecurity is an issue â€“ but to the extent that one chooses to make it a barrier from letting one enjoy the â€œgoodness of the landâ€�. There are sections of the city that I would not recommend any tourist to go to â€“ I would not even go there myself! But come to think of it, I live in Chicago, and I dread each time I have to drive through certain neighborhoods on the south side. Does that stop me from living there? No.To the people who have never experienced Kenya, let me tell you what my experience of Kenya is. Kenya is not just about famous runners or wildlife or insecurity or slum areas or whatever myopic images CNN or other media place in our minds. For one to truly enjoy Kenya, one has to get to know the people. Kenyans are the most peace loving people you would ever get to meet. They are also some of the best educated I have ever met. Why that has not translated into greater economic prosperity lies in the hands of our politicians. So I challenge all those who think that we are defined by what foreign investors have put up to take this simple challenge â€“ Visit Nairobi, Visit Mombasa, Visit the rural populations of the Rift Vally and Western/Nyanza Regions. Come back, post your opinions and we will talk. 1 Like  ',\n",

The Government is planning 3 major resort cities that cater solely for tourist attractions, something akin to Sun City South Africa, or Vegas.  The company that manage/own the KICC Building are planning a MASSIVE expansion that will cost kshs 17 billion to build an expand the KICC to a fully fledged international conference complex, that will house a seven star hotel, malls, restaurants, helipads( for shuttling btween the airport and the center), churches, mosques, etc.  The Plans have already been submitted to the authorities for approval.  By early 2009, all the kenyan districts will be connected/wired via fiberoptic cable, thereby making kenya the african country with the highest amount of broadband penetration. Actually a big portion of the country is already internally wired, all that's pending is the building of the external fiber optic cable that will connect kenya to the outside world, and that i t an advanced stage.  The Port of Mombasa is operating 24/7 and by 2009 it will a paperless port, everything will be computerised. Right now, no doubt kenya is at an increasing economic trajectory and this will go on because of the policies the govt is setting. Y'all must understand that it was not always this way. But Since the change of leadership in 2002, the new govt proceeded to revive kenya.   I think everything good is derived from good leadership.To all the Naija people out there, I must say that Naija is a force to reckon with too. Naija is the one of the few developing nations to completely pay up it's international debts, a very big move. Naija people - at least the ones I've met here in the states are a very aggressive lot, especially the young educated ones.  one main challenge Naija has despite having oil is the population. 100 million plus people; that will definitely put a strain on the resources, but Naija is one african tiger too, I don't know much about political freedoms there though\",\n",

The government will fund the project at a cost of over 1 billion dollars. This will make Kenya the Africa's ICT hub. Already Kenya is one of the top ten Worlds ICT hubs. The industrial town will have 24hr internet connectivity thro' fibre optic network. Large godowns will be set up and equiped with telecommunication and ICT facilities to be rented out to out-sourcing companies. In this, Kenya will topple India as the world leading out-sourcing centre. Out-sourcing business currently rakes in over 1 billion dollars to Kenya's economy annually and this will increase to 20 billion dollars after completion of this project.By next year, everybody in Kenya from city to rural folks will have internet access after completion of laying fibre optic cable which is currently in progress under  the government funded Digital Village project. Also to boost and reduce internet charges is the completion of Mombasa-Fujaira in UAE fibre optic cable.Kenya and South Africa are the only countries in Africa to have two sets of Root Servers i.e J and F root servers for redundancy, .COM, .NET and .KE locally resolving. This makes Kenya as the key strategic hub for internet content hosting and transit services in Africa. In the next three years ICT will be the major player in Kenya's economy.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"ROPIE, Eaze up on the optimism chief, I'm not being negative but claiming that Kenya will topple india as an outsorcing hub is stretching it. India has been doing this for a while and they have  a tonne of experience plus contracts. It will take time before we take away market share from them, because we have to build credibility. and remember, in kenya we still have a perception problem. Alot of western folk think of kenya as ideal for safari, etc, not outsorcing, but that can be overcome.  In May Feb this year I met a few kenyan businessmen who'd come to boston for a conference. one of them had a very smart strategy about competing with india for outsourcing. His idea was that Kenya will look to complement India not compete directly. very smart and it made sense.  One thing I'd like to emphasize again and again is that for any country to improve , it requires god strong and visionary leadership.  I like Dubai because despite having oil resources, it has aggressively diversified it's economy to the point that it is a top 5 global finance center after NYC, London, Hong Kong, Sydney.  They have a visionary leader. I mean, the guy could have sat back and said he'd be all set coz of their oil, but No, he diversified the economy.   5 years ago in kenya, it was not this way. we had a leader who stagnated the economy and he;d been in power for 24 yrs.  Right now kenya is aggressive and it's playing catch up, that's why I say that we have just begun. South Africa gets props not doubt, but let;s be honest, alot of he development there was done during apartheid, the white minority gvt there really built their economy, but Kenya's economy is majority indigenoues. Yes kenyans have built kenya, black, indian, arab, white, all have built it.  South African companies expand everywhere in the continent but have the hardest time setting shop in kenya. Most of their firms come in and encounter such stiff competitition that they end up closing shop. Barnetts furniture tried but the local furniture manufacturers beat them out.   South African Brewing had a difficult time sustaining market share dominated by kenya breweries.Just recently the kenya railway system was privatise and sold to a south african firm. So far, there is not a whole lot of people happy with them. To kenyans, they are slow at adapting.infact their own CEO complained that kenyans are an impatient lot, they want to see results ASAP! and he was right.   The current kenyan govt is very agressive and progressive too. they are pushing for the forging of the east africa community, made up of 5 countries.  They are doing this in order to market  and position the area as one encompassing over 100 milliom people as opposed to a single country. This is a very smart move, and again I repeat, it all boils down to leadership.   I am surprised at people from Naija saying that Nigerians are loosing their identity/culture  and following Mr Biggs. I must say, I'm shocked coz all the Naija people I've encountered are always proud of their heritage. but again, I'm in the sttae, maybe the Niaja people in  Nigeria behave that way.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Back From NairobiA commentary by Valentine Obienyem, the Special Assistant to the Governor of Anambra State (in Nigeria).ONE of the most profound pronouncements from a Nigerian Minister was the remarks by the Federal Minister of Education, Dr. Oby Ezekwesili. The Honourable Minister said that the Government would review the criteria for the award of honorary doctorate degrees by universities. The bastardisation of awards in Nigeria, which has also crept into the Ivory Towers, is worrisome to well meaning Nigerians.Ideally, not everybody has the opportunity of pursuing education up to doctorate level, when you are certified as a true expert in your chosen field. However, some people with the requisite experience, even more experienced than academic doctors are conferred with honorary doctorates. We cannot quarrel if any University confers honorary doctorate on person like Chief Austin Ilodibe in transportation, because he is truly experienced even more than the books on transportation. What we quarrel with is placing cash values on the awards, thus honouring even little minds that stumbled into money and use it to buy their way without any form of experience. The key word is experienceOracle Content & CollaborationTalking about experience, the wise one says that education comes one fourth from schools, one fourth from experience, one fourth from the teacher and one fourth from travel. We gain much from these sources if we are positively disposed or confront them with open minds. A good example is the refrain of Nigeria being the giant of Africa. The notion of being a giant has made most Nigerians suffer delusions of grandeur, to believe that Nigeria is the first in terms of everything as far as African is concerned. You need the experience of travel to know whether this is true or false.At the risk of sounding immodest, I have travelled widely within the sub-saharan Africa: Benin Republic, Togo, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea (Conakry), and Senegal. Abidjan and Accra are good cities in their own rights. But talking about places like Liberia, Freetown, Conakry, you talk about some primitive, uninspiring towns, where women still go about the towns in the happy ignorance of their unclothedness.Recently, I had the opportunity of travelling to Kenya, Nairobi, with my Governor and boss, His Excellency, Mr. Peter Obi. Before Mr. Peter Obi became the Governor, he was the Chairman of Fidelity Bank and a Director in many other banks and companies. As a banker and a successful international business man, he moved around the world, from temperate to tropical zone from East to West and North to South attending one course or the other, one conference or seminar or the other.However, since he became the Governor, he has not been travelling except strictly on official tours. He kept postponing the day he would visit his family in the UK, until the children became tired and had to come to Awka to see him. You may call this the demonstration of the fact that if the mountain cannot go to Muhammed, Muhammed will go to the mountain.Recently, the Governor had a reason to travel to Kenya. Passionate about having Master plans for Awka, Onitsha and Nnewi, he had to travel to Nairobi to meet with the United Nation HABITAT and Shelter Afrique. Seeing the passion and the eagerness with which the Governor pursed this, the Organisation, as well as Shelter Afrique, promised to help him. Commending him, the under Secretary and Chief Executive of UN HABITAT, Dr. Anna Kajumulo Tibaijuka said that the Governor was a good example on true governace.Typical of him, to save cost for the State, he travels, locally and internationally with a few people. Beyond saving cost, he always says that those in power find it difficult to relinquish power because they surround themselves with many aides that the prospect of surrendering power becomes frightful to them. Obi reminds me of Chief Chukwuemeka Chikelu, who, as Minister, would go to the counter at the Airport and do things for himself. Once I asked him why, and he said: \"I do not want to live a borrowed life even as a Minister, so that any day if I cease being one, it will be easy to continue my normal life. In the case of Governor Obi, he usually tells us that being a Governor will not make him not to live his normal life.Accept my apologies if I have digressed a bit. On the trip to Nairobi were the Governor and I. We flew Kenyan Airways, which is inscribed \"The pride of Africa.\"This at once aroused a sense of regret in me as a Nigerian. Is it not the place of former Nigeria\\'s Airways that Kenyan Airways has taken? If not for mismanagement, what would have been of Nigerian Airways? At the time our Airways was functioning, was it not far bigger than Kenyan Airways in many respects? These are necessary questions.At Nairobi, I saw what was beyond my imagination. Let me go straight to the verdict: Nairobi is far better than any Nigerian city you can possibly think of, including Abuja. Once at the Airport, you are bound to admire the order pervading the entire place. Though not as busy as Muritala Muhammed International Airport, it is better organized. In fact, some people told me, unverified, that the airport was built at the cost of Twenty-Five Million Naira (equivalent); while our own was at the cost of over Two Hundred Million Naira. But the two are big as to relatively cost the same.Driving from the Airport to the town was a pleasant one. I took time looking at the street lights, and behold not even one bulb was not lit. Straight, we drove to Nairobi Serena Hotel. In fact, when we got there, because it was night, I could not really compare Nairobi and Abuja in terms of aesthetics. But when it was down, I saw Nairobi in its unclothedness.Being an old city, Nairobi roads are not so wide. However, unlike our own disordered cities, Nairobi is clothed with flowers and the buildings are superior to most that we find in Nigeria. The transport companies, especially the ubiquitious Citi Hopper are far better that intra-city buses in Nigeria. Foreigners enter it with ease, no standing, no careless driving.Working with Governor Obi is business not pleasure, he makes sure you add enough value to the trip to justify your travelling with him. Though as we were about to land at the airport, some places of interest such as Giraffe Park, Animal Orphanage, Nairobi National Musseum,etc were announced, but we did not go to Nairobi for a picnic, not with my Governor, but for business. On our return, as we touch down Nigerian soil, Kenyan Airways did not announce any place of interest in Nigeria. This is instructive.Oracle Content & CollaborationHowever, in the spirit of adventure, I still managed to look out. Close to the beautiful Serena hotel is the Uhuru Park, a spacious park for recreation. If it were in Nigeria, corner shops would have taken its place. But in Nairobi, it is well maintained, and I understand such parks are all over the place. As you move along Nairobi streets you see public conveniences, neat and properly maintained. It will certainly be a source of revenue. In fact, it made me remember a king who built urinals around his kingdom, his son protested on why trying to make money from such a dirty place. When the money came, he took some close to his nose and asked: \"Do they smell of urine?\"Nairobi is amazingly clean, especially when juxtaposed with Abuja. Without Okada plying the streets, you will not even see a single sheet of paper or pure water nylons on the ground. No wonder the city attracts foreigners. At Serena hotel, 98% of the guests are foreigners. You are therefore left to imagine how much the country makes on tourism. One Nigerian there said that what oil was to Nigeria was what tourism was to Kenya.I had the opportunity of visiting University of Nairobi. Right inside the city, it is a reflection of the entire city: neat, organized and exuding scholarship. In my venturesome way, I interacted with some of the students and was not disappointed.Nairobi has good hospitals, good schools and good weather. Though Nigerians seem well-to-do, but Nairobi is more of a human society than our disordered country controlled by bedlam.Two days in Nairobi was a pleasant experience. As we touch down at Murtala Mohammed Airport, I was nostalgic about Kenya. A city where I did not witness police taking bribes openly, dry taps, power interruption. A city where right-hand driving is still in vogue. At our airport, we had to wait for some minutes for the generator to be put on, because the conveyor belt stopped when NEPA interrupted power. Regrettably, this was a reminding welcome to Nigeria, the land where,',\n",

About the visa issue, it is also pretty easy to get one. Please contact the kenyan embassy in your country of residence or your travel agent for more details. There lots of great places to visit in kenya, you can stay in cosmopolitan nairobi or drive off to one of the many world class game parks. Or you can go to the beaches at the coast, go hiking in the rift valley or kick off at a lake side resort. You can even climb mt kenya. Im just trying to show you the many options available and my advise is to have an idea of what you want to experience. If u need more info id be glad to give it to you. Bon voyage.',\n",

I hear they\\'ve commissioned the start of construction of several superhighways with eight lanes with the help of the Chinese.Â\\xa0 The airport also is being refurbished and expanded to become one of the biggest and most modern in the Southern horizon. If you\\'ve been to Nairobi lately, you will notice that litering, spitting and smoking in public is illegal. Throw a sweet wrapping on the ground and you\\'ll end up facing a magistrate.Without oil and literally no natural mineral resources, Kenya overtook the European Union to become the largest exporter of manufactured goods into the Comesa region. The country has not factored in donor aid in its budget the last three years making it one of the first in Africa to attempt sovereignty from donors and the Bretton Wood institutions. The economy is owned by Kenyans and multinationals like BP are leaving because they cannot compete with local petrol distributors. Nandos, Steers and all those international chains of restaurants have been literally routed out of Nairobi and other cities by indigenous restaurants that sell quality locally sourced cuisines at half the price. SAfrican Supreme Furnitures and Barnette could not compete with local artisans and left the country. Others like Shoprite, Game and Pick and Pay have been unable to penetrate the Kenyan dominated supermarket sector. SAB tried to enter the East African market in a big way with Castle Lager only to be outdone by Kenya-based and indigenous East African Breweries and had to bow out. Nairobi Stock Exchange is literally owned by ordinary Kenyans, who line up everyday to buy shares. Kenya airways is among the 5 most profitable airlines in the world. When the airline was privatized a few years ago more than 70% shares went to Kenyans. Only 29% was sold to KLM - a strategic partnership that really paid off. What is happening to Nigeria ohh? Right, left, centre in Lagos is South African products and companies. Even our oil is not ours ! O lordie! God help us.\"',\n",

We only think of you for athletics and wildlife,\\' \" says Gilda Odera, managing director of Skyweb-Evans in the heart of the capital, Nairobi. \"But people are getting really interested in us.\"Her call center and a dozen others are seeds of an industry that the government hopes will put the East African country on equal terms with India as an outsourcing destination.The government is pumping millions of dollars into improving the country\\'s outdated telecom system in an effort to capitalize on Kenya\\'s large pool of English-speaking graduates.Eventually it wants Kenya to be as well-known for its call centers as its lions, tea, and coffee.But for now, companies like Skyweb-Evans are limited by shoddy infrastructure and ferociously expensive internet connections.Ms. Odera employs more than 40 people in two shifts. They mostly dial Canada to collect market research and polling data, but she says it can be a struggle to break even.\"Sometimes we have clients that need more than 20 seats but, because we haven\\'t been able to ramp up, we haven\\'t been able to take the work, even though it was attractive work,\" says Odera.That is all about to change. In February, her company will open a 75-seat call center, expanding capacity more than threefold.New fiber-optic cableLast week, the Kenyan government signed an agreement with French-US telecom group Alcatel-Lucent for a fiber-optic cable linking the Kenyan port of Mombasa with the United Arab Emirates.More important, it will connect East Africa to the rest of the world\\'s Internet capacity and replace the slow and costly satellite links that act as a brake on the country\\'s fast developing industry in business process outsourcing (BPO).At the signing, Bitange Ndemo, permanent secretary at the Ministry of Information and Communications, said the connection would allow more ordinary Kenyans to surf the Internet. But the real driving force behind the deal, he said, was the potential for creating jobs in call centers and the rest of the outsourcing industry.\"A year ago we started pushing ourselves as a BPO center,\" he said. \"But if you look at the price and compare it with our competition, we are simply not competitive.\"Typical monthly charges are $7,500 for one megabyte of bandwidth. Elsewhere in the world it costs no more than $400.\"If we can get it below $500 for that megabyte we can make ourselves more competitive,\" said Mr. Ndemo.Work on the 3,062-mile East African Marine System (Teams) cable is due to begin early in the new year.The $82-million cable will run from Fujaira, in the UAE, along the seabed of the Gulf of Oman and down the African coastline to Mombasa. It is expected to bring the cost of connectivity down to about $500 per month immediately on completion in January 2009. In the meantime, the government will use $9 million from a World Bank loan to subsidize connections and kickstart the industry in the new year. Two other cables are also being planned. The much delayed East Africa Submarine Cable System will eventually run along the Indian Ocean coastline, connecting 10 African cities with India and Europe. And a third will run from Europe to South Africa. Ndemo said the cost will continue to come down as Kenya becomes a hub for East Africa, selling bandwidth to neighbors such as Tanzania, Uganda, and Sudan. Mark Kobayashi-Hillary, off-shoring director of Britain\\'s National Outsourcing Association, says Kenya is putting itself in a strong position. \"In Kenya â€“ and the East African region â€“ they have quite a good recent history of democracy, so it is a stable region and there are lots of well-educated people,\" he said. \"That\\'s a good start, but what they don\\'t have is the infrastructure and I guess that\\'s the importance of this fiber-optics deal.\" A promising futureResearch by the London-based business analysis group Datamonitor supports the optimistic outlook. In a report published last year, the group forecast that Africa would see the fastest growth in the number of call centers for the rest of the decade, and singled out Egypt, Botswana, Ghana, and Kenya for particularly rapid expansion. Egypt already has a booming outsourcing industry with many Western companies operating there. Meanwhile, Botswana, Ghana, and Kenya â€“ all former British colonies â€“ have the sort of linguistic skills and education systems that make them well placed for call centers, according to the report. And signs of a shift in the global pattern emerged earlier this year as several Indian companies began looking to outsource their own outsourcing operations, as rising wages and crumbling infrastructure took their toll. Across town from Skyweb-Evans, Kencall is the posterboy for Kenya\\'s outsourcing industry. Kencall employs 500 people in a converted avocado warehouse on an industrial estate close to Nairobi\\'s international airport. Nicholas Nesbitt, its chief executive, says there is a ready pool of investors looking to enter the Kenyan industry, particularly from South Africa where labor costs are much higher. \"We\\'ve had a good three or four very big international call center companies coming through Kenya and kicking the tires,\" he says. \"As long as we can keep the drumbeat of Kenya as a good and positive place to invest, then when the time comes people will move in.\"',\n",

       "  'text': 'Nairobi Has Great Personality, But is That Sustainable?Nairobi voted amongst 200 best cities in the worldNairobians might be pleasantly surprised to learn that their city has been rated as among the 200 best cities in the world. The list of 200 cities, selected by the staff, authors and readers of the Lonely Planet travel guide, is not scientific or based on any measurable quality of life index, but is based on qualities that are hard to measure, such as a city\\'s \"personality\" and its \"human architecture\".The top five cities on the Lonely Planet list are, not surprisingly, Paris, New York, Sydney, Barcelona and London. But other cities, which one would not normally categorise as \"world class\", such as Ho Chi Minh City, Kathmandu, Cairo, Mexico City, Zanzibar Town, Havana and Kolkata are also rated highly (all made it to the top 100 best cities list).THE LONELY PLANET RATINGS differ significantly from other more scientific surveys, such as the William M. Mercer quality-of-life survey that ranks a city\\'s \"liveabily\" though indicators such as its ability to provide its citizens with clean air, affordable housing, infrastructure, meaningful employment and green parks and spaces. When liveability is taken into account, Canadian and Australian cities, such as Vancouver, Melbourne, Montreal, Perth and Toronto always emerge as the most liveable cities.African and Asian cities have always struggled to make it to this list because of their large slums, not to mention their crumbling infrastructure. But for the Lonely Planet authors, a city is more than its physical infrastructure. Bangkok rates the highest (ranked 8th) on their list of best Asian cities (despite its pollution and congestion) because of its lively markets, cafes and 24-hour shopping. Singapore, undoubtedly Asia\\'s most \"liveable\" city, on the other hand, ranks 25th.What the authors are emphasising is that what makes a city great is not its architecture or its air quality, but its people, its social fabric, its vibrancy, its diversity, its culture and its dynamism. Nairobi, which The Lonely Planet authors dubbed as \"The Safari Capital of the World\", is rated 135th for its various strengths, including \"excellent night spots, the Westlands Triangle Curios Market, a good selection of restaurants and bars and its proximity to Africa\\'s natural wonders\".The city\\'s physical anatomy is described thus: \"This young city, with its ultra-modern skyline and few remaining colonial era buildings, spreads from the city centre into the energetic working class suburbs, the wealthy garden suburbs of expats and the notorious sprawl of shantytowns\". The typical Nairobian is defined as someone who likes \"going out for a drink after work and socialising in cafes, restaurants and clubs, and shopping in malls and markets\".Before Nairobians congratulate themselves for joining the global consumer class, they might want to ponder this: The same authors rate Nairobi poorly for its \"poverty, rampant crime, few laundrettes, political instability, ever-present prostitutes and the Aids epidemic\".There is no question that Nairobi ranks among the most unequal cities in the world. The city has gained the unenviable reputation of a being city with one thousand Prados and one million pedestrians.A recent survey found that most slum residents - at least half the city\\'s population - reside in shacks no bigger than 9 square metres with little or no access to safe water or adequate sanitation.Despite the dehumanising living conditions, people continue to pour into the slums. Why? Because living in a city means having better employment opportunities. Slum dwellers need the jobs generated by city-based industries and enterprises to survive, and they need affordable housing (currently provided by slums) to be able to compete in a job market where labour is cheap and where rents for better housing are unaffordable.In every city, including Nairobi, slums are sites of immense opportunity and enterprise, where dreams of escaping poverty are first nurtured. But when the gap between the haves and have-nots becomes unbearably wide, slums can also be the sites of conflict and violence. The economic gains achieved in cities are thus severely hampered by insecurity, resulting in reduced competitiveness and fewer investments.IN EVERY \"WORLD CLASS CITY\", including London and New York, which are rated highly in almost every survey, national and local governments made concerted efforts to upgrade slums or to provide subsidies to the urban poor. For instance, when slums began posing a health hazard to London\\'s residents in the late 19th century, the government built low-cost subsidised housing for the working classes who were helping Britain to industrialise.By the mid 20th century, slums were a thing of the past in Britain and its working classes were among the most heavily subsidised group of people in the Western world. Today London is ranked among the best cities for business, culture, art and innovation.If Nairobi wants to move up in its ranking as one of the world\\'s best cities, then it too must consciously make an effort to make the city liveable for all its residents, not just those who can afford to shop in its wonderful malls, eat at its trendy restaurants and visit its vibrant night spots.__________________South East Nine',\n",
